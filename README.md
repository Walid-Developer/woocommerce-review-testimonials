# woocommerce-review-testimonials


Styling:
Style the testimonials by adding CSS to your theme's stylesheet or through an additional CSS file. You can target the .testimonial, .content, .rating, and .author classes to customize their appearance.

Usage:
To use the plugin, add the shortcode [woocommerce_testimonials] 
example [woocommerce_testimonials product_id="{product ID} " count="5"]

to any post or page where you want to display the testimonials.

In this CSS code, I've provided styles for both the individual testimonials and the testimonial slider for displaying them one by one. The slider uses the .testimonial-slider container, and each testimonial is a .testimonial-slide. Navigation buttons are added for moving between slides.

To implement the slider functionality, you'll need to incorporate JavaScript/jQuery. However, JavaScript implementation is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response. There are several JavaScript libraries and plugins available that can help you create a testimonial slider, such as Slick Slider or Swiper.

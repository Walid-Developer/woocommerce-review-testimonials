# woocommerce-review-testimonials

In this CSS code, I've provided styles for both the individual testimonials and the testimonial slider for displaying them one by one. The slider uses the .testimonial-slider container, and each testimonial is a .testimonial-slide. Navigation buttons are added for moving between slides.

To implement the slider functionality, you'll need to incorporate JavaScript/jQuery. However, JavaScript implementation is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response. There are several JavaScript libraries and plugins available that can help you create a testimonial slider, such as Slick Slider or Swiper.
